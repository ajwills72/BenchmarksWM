# BenchmarksWM
R data package for benchmark experiments in working memory research. 
## Notes
WORK IN PROGRESS. The purpose of this forked repository is to generate an R
data package from oberauer/BenchmarksWM. I'll add some build instructions
later, and aim eventually to make stable releases available via CRAN.
